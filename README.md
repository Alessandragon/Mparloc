## Introduction
We implemant a Bayesian method for the earthquake location which combines 
the information derived from the differential P-wave and S-wave arrival times, 
amplitude ratios and back-azimuths measured at a minimum of two stations. 
A complete posterior pdf of location is provided as a probability map on the 
computational grids and uncertainty of location is estimate as the range where 
the probability is over a prefixed threshold.
